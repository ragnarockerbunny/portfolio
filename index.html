                    Matthew here, sometimes online I go by <strong>ragnarockerbunny</strong>, I'm a web developer based in Hartbeespoort, South Africa. 
                    I absolutely love good project and I live to build and create. Having spent time in retail I understand how hard it can be to work with difficult customers, and since I've been clacking away at a keyboard since seven, I also know what it's like to deal with difficult software problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want a design built, if you need to create a web app, if you're looking for a front-end engineer with more tenacity than sense, you've come to the right place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a self-taught programmer whose touched on everything from C to LUA to Python to Javascript, but my main expertise is in web development. I've completed courses like CS50 and FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development With React, as well as built games on my own time. I'm a three time GMTK Game Jam participant, having ranked 511th out of 20 000 in my best year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My method for doing what I do is simple; Understand the problem space, break it down into steps and work through it one by one. Sometimes it takes research, sometimes there's that one property you've forgotten that's on the tip of your tongue, but in the end, it just takes perserverance.
